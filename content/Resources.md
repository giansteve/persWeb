title: Resources and more

This is a growing collection of research-oriented tools, prototypes, and open-source projects that I develop and maintain as part of ongoing technical and methodological exploration, but also only "for fun".

- [UQtab](https://uqtab.com)
  I am developing a sensitivity analysis platform that computes a range of sensitivity metrics from input–output data only. No model internals or structural assumptions are required: you provide the data, and the application handles the analysis.
  
  The project is currently under active development and maintained by a single developer (me) as a long-term research effort. Although some features are still evolving, the core functionality is already available for testing.
  
  If you choose to explore the platform, any feedback would be highly appreciated.

- [WCAG Contrast Wheel](https://wcagwheel.com/)
  I made a free visual tool that shows which colors are accessible against any background using official [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/) contrast rules.
  
  Instead of guessing or checking one color at a time, you can see accessible color regions directly on a color wheel, with live text previews and real-time contrast boundaries.
  
  No installs. No libraries. Runs entirely in your browser.
  The code is available on my GitHub.
