## Mehrkörperdynamik (Multibody dynamics) - Exercise unit

>[!news]
>This course is nominated, **again**, for the "Preis für exzellente Lehre" (Price for excellence in Teaching) for the academic year 2025/26
### Master's course in Mechanical Engineering  
- **Term**: Winter semester  
- **Language**: English + German
- **Offered**: since 2022

I teach a Master's course on implementing solutions for the motion of multibody systems using Python, Matlab, and Mathematica. Students are evaluated based on a real-world group project completed by teams of three. 

Starting from the winter semester 2024, the course includes Python coding for the same exercises and is offered exclusively in English.
