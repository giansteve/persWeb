- **When:** 19 - 24 July 2026
- **Where:** Munich, Germany
- **What:**
	- **MS203: Sensitivity Analysis in Science and Engineering** - S. Brandstaeter, G.M. Melito, F. Schäfer, W. Huberts, B. Sudret
	  
	  This 1st MS explores recent advances in global sensitivity analysis for science and engineering. It focuses on how variations in model inputs affect outputs, improving understanding, robustness, and decision-making in complex, data-driven models. Topics will include sensitivity analysis with data, identifiability and parameter estimation, and explainability in scientific machine learning, all of which foster collaboration between theorists and practitioners in modern computational modeling.
	  
	- **MS120: Recent Advances in Computational Methods for the Cardiovascular System** - R. Schussnig, A. Ranno, I. Steinbrecher, M. Rolf, G.M. Melito, and C. Armour
	  
	  The 2nd MS addresses emerging topics in cardiovascular system modeling, from methodology development to clinical translation. It highlights physics-based and data-driven approaches for understanding and predicting cardiovascular behavior. Topics include continuum and reduced-order modeling, machine learning, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and patient-specific applications. The session promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between applied mathematics, biomechanics, and biomedical engineering to advance personalized computational medicine. 

The second appointment with **Computational Mechanics** is still at the ECCOMAS conference, but this time in Munich (Germany).

_I hope to see you there._
