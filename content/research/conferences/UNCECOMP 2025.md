- [UNCECOMP 2025](https://2025.uncecomp.org/)
- **When:** 15 - 18 June 2025
- **Where:** Rhodes, Greece
- **What:** Minisymposium on Sensitivity Analysis

Computational models are widely used in science and engineering to predict complex systems, requiring a balance between model complexity and input data accuracy. This balance is crucial in applications like digital twins, where both precision and speed are necessary for decision-critical scenarios. Global sensitivity analysis helps optimize models by identifying key parameters, reducing uncertainties, and improving robustness. Various methods have been developed to address computational costs and complexities while ensuring accurate predictions. This mini-symposium seeks contributions on methodological advancements and applications of sensitivity analysis in engineering and scientific models.

## After the conference

It was a true pleasure to organize and participate in UNCECOMP 2025 in Greece this June. Our minisymposium was a great success, sparking thoughtful discussions despite the limited time. I am loving the sensitivity analysis community for this.

I look forward to seeing you all again, possibly at WCCM 2026 in Munich, Germany. Let us continue pushing boundaries.

_Until then — stay tuned ;)_
