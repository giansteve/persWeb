My research has been highly interdisciplinary, focusing on the application of advanced mathematical, computational, and engineering techniques to biomedical challenges, particularly related to cardiovascular health and fluid mechanics. The recurring themes in my work involve sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and the integration of multiphysics simulations to improve diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for cardiovascular diseases.

## During my PhD

I have focused on various aspects of aortic dissection in my scientific career. I was a member of a major project funded by TU Graz from 2018 to 2024, during which I completed my PhD. My primary areas of interest revolved around the application and advancement of global sensitivity analysis techniques, particularly in the following areas:

- Fluid mechanics and cardiovascular haemodynamics
- Impedance cardiography in aortic dissection
- Thrombosis modeling
- Simulation-based diagnostic frameworks

## Currently

I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Mechanics (TU Graz). I will continue to research and analyze uncertainties and their propagation in computational models. My goal is to explore the modeling domain to interpret and quantify the role of model uncertainties and their implications.
