Hi!

I am Gian Marco **Melito**, 

Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Mechanics](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ifm/home) at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). 

My research focuses on **uncertainty quantification** and **sensitivity analysis** of mathematical models, with a particular interest in the mechanics and modeling of **aortic dissection** and other cardiovascular conditions. I'm also passionate about exploring broader applications of these techniques in different fields.

I love teaching and working with students, helping them grow academically and professionally. I am currently teaching the exercise section of the Master's course in **Multibody Dynamics** (Mechanical Engineering program) and supporting the Bachelor's courses **Mechanik - Statik** and **Mechanik - Dynamik** for the Biomedical Engineering program.
