title: Welcome

I am Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Mechanics](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ifm/home) at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). 

My research focuses on **uncertainty quantification** and **sensitivity analysis** of computational mechanics, with a particular interest in the mechanics and modeling of **[[aortic dissection]]**. Uncertainty and stochasticity are everywhere around us, from the tools we use every day, to the natural and artificial phenomena happening around us. Although this can feel overwhelming, I find there is a fascinating side in it. 

Teaching is my duty at the university, but also something I love doing. Working with students, helping them grow academically and professionally is nice to experience to see in their path. I am currently teaching the exercise section of the Master's course in **Multibody Dynamics** (Mechanical Engineering program) and supporting the Bachelor's courses **Mechanik - Statik** and **Mechanik - Dynamik** for the Biomedical Engineering program.
